## Game Description

The game is a 2 player game where each player controls a spaceship. its started by running the main.py file, which then opens a program window. 
From there {Player 1} is controlled with '{W}' to boost in the direction of the ship,
'{A}' and '{D}' to turning the ship left or right respectively and '{S}' to shooting a bullet.
{Player 2} controls given in the same order are '{Arrow Up}', '{Arrow Left}', '{Arrow Right}' and '{Arrow Down}'.
The goal is to shoot each other to gain points and avoid dying by either crashing or getting shot.
Fuel is also lost by boosting and can be regained by landing on the fuel pads (gray platforms).
